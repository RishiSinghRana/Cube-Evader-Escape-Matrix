# Cube-Evader-Escape-Matrix
Hello Connections! I am excited to announce the launch of my latest project, Cube Evader: Escape Matrix ! ðŸŽ®

This game was created using Unity3D and offers an immersive experience with three challenging levels. Players navigate through a dynamic environment, dodging obstacles and mastering their reflexes to progress. The level is automatically restarted again if you hit an obstacle.

Cube Evader's intuitive controls using the A and D keys for left and right movement make the gameplay engaging and accessible.

From designing the start menu to crafting the credits, every aspect of Cube Evader was a work of love. I owe a huge shoutout to the amazing tutorials on YouTube that guided me through the development process.

Ready to dive into the Matrix? Play Cube Evader now and see if you can escape its labyrinthine challenges!
